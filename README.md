## Introduction  
Challenge your friends in this 1v1, real-time, NLP-powered, word based game, to find out who is the real lexicon legend. Made in collaboration with [Yash Goyal](https://github.com/ycatsh).
  

## Functionality  
- Lexicon Legends is a word game web-based app that allows users to 1v1 their friends and rank up with Elo rating.    
- Once a game room is made and started, the players have to blitz out similar words to the randomly generated one.      
- The player with the best average score accross their inputs wins and is rewarded by some Elo whereas the player who lost loses Elo.    
- We used [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to calculate text similarity between the user inputs and the randomly generated words.  
  

## What's Next?
- In the future, we plan to add more features to Lexicon Legends to enhance the gameplay experience. This includes adding different game modes, allowing players to select difficulty levels, and adding a leaderboard to track player scores.  
- Optimizing the game further to ensure smooth and seamless gameplay for players.  
- Adding several other mini-word-games. With a wide range of options to choose from, we think that players will enjoy our games more and more, and will improve their vocabulary in the process.
